My name is Tusaif A., and I have just completed my BSc (Honours) computer science June 2022 from Toronto Metropolitan University (formerly Ryerson University).

I'm currently on the lookout for a breakthrough that will allow me to use technology to solve problems and plan for the future. I am capable of writing and programming software for the creation of applications. My main focus, however, is on validating and developing models for human-computer or software-device interaction.
